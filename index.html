This is not an official Vacaville Christian Schools website. 
VCHS StuCo made this website.
We're gonna update this later, so that students and parents can sign to support our dress code amendment proposals for (i) earrings for boys and (ii) allowing hats in chapel.
This should be finished in about 2 days. Thank you!
