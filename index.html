<h1>Petition for Dress Code Amendment Proposal at Vacaville Christian High School</h1>
<b>This is not an official Vacaville Christian Schools website.</b>
<br>
This website is created by the Vacaville Christian High School Student Council.
<br>
This website will be later updated, so that students and parents can sign for petition to support our dress code amendment proposal for <b>(i)</b> earrings for boys and <b>(ii)</b> allowing hats in chapel.
<br>
The latest version (Version II) of the proposal is available <a href="proposa.pdf">here</a>.
